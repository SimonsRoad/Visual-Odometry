3DNavigationReconstructor
=========================

Reconstruc the navigated path using video

This project was conducted for the subject "Vision in Robotics", University of Buenos Aires.

It consists in two parts, the first uses a stereo video recording to calculate the DISPARITY MAP.

The second part uses a regular video of a moving camera to reconstruct the path followed by it.
It can be done by calculating the displacing and rotation of the camera between frames.

To compile the first part just execute "make" standing on the proyect root.
To compile the second part you should do the same standing on "tpfinal" folder.
